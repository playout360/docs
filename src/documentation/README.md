# Introduction

The idea is to implement a modern video playout system which can be used for different type of users. For example a SAAS provider can use this software to provide online playout system to their clients. Or a TV channel provider can use this software as on-premise deployment in their isolated network like PCR and use it as  standalone playout to feed to their channels.
